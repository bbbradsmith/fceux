test_nametables branch

This is a special build of FCEUX for making videos explaining the internal operation of the NES.

You will find four nametables, and the pattern table available under Config > Display. Choose one of them to have them replace the rendered picture. Generally you will want to record a movie of the action you wish to capture first, then render it multiple times with different display settings.

New PPU setting is required.

## Builds and Releases

win32 autobuilds @ https://ci.appveyor.com/project/zeromus/fceux/build/artifacts

You should get releases from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/fceultra/files/

That's because github forces us to use tags we don't have for releases.

2.2.3 is the most recent release but most people are using the autobuilds.
